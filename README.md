# L4D2AccurateAmmoPile
A remake of the weapon_ammo_spawn and weapon_spawn entity from Left 4 Dead series to GMod.

Something i made while bored last night, works just like the L4D ones work, just lacks a few features

TODO:
AMMO SPAWN:
-Nothing

WEAPON SPAWN:
-Make it fetch attachment data from ArcCW (incase of presets)
-Do the rest of the spawners (Melees, grenades, specials)
-Fix positioning of the weapon models
-Make it respect additional keyvalues (No CS, Tier Proximity)
