# L4D2AccurateAmmoPile
A remake of the weapon_ammo_spawn entity from Left 4 Dead series to GMod.

Something i made while bored last night, works just like the L4D ones work, just lacks a few features

TODO:

- Make the weapon_ammo_spawn entity actually take the map keyvalues / models / usecount into consideration
